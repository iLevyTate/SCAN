---

The SCAN project aims to develop a sophisticated multi-agent system that replicates the functions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) using AI agents.

---

## Features

- Simulates complex cognitive functions of the PFC
- Utilizes multiple specialized AI agents for different cognitive tasks
- Integrates generative AI for decision making and analysis
- Tracks task progress and updates details dynamically
- Provides detailed reports on cognitive task simulations

---

## Tech Stack

- CrewAI: Framework for orchestrating role-playing, autonomous AI agents
- LangChain: Framework for building language model applications
- Python: Core programming language
- OpenAI GPT API: Generative AI for advanced decision making
- dotenv: For managing environment variables

---

## Solution

Professionals and researchers in neuroscience and AI often struggle with simulating complex cognitive functions of the brain. The SCAN project provides a robust multi-agent system that can simulate the functions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), enabling detailed analysis and decision-making simulations. This system can help in understanding cognitive processes and developing advanced AI applications that mimic human cognitive functions.
